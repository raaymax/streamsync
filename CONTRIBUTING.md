## Contributing to the repository

If you wish to contribute to the repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via issue, email, or any other method with the owners of this repository before making a change. Failure to discuss the changes beforehand will likely cause your pull request to be rejected, regrettably.

Make sure to run the tests, which can be found in `/tests`, and pass mypy validation. Code formatting is important; Prettier is used in the frontend while autopep8 is used in the backend.

Pull requests should be done on the `dev` branch. When the release is finalised, `dev` will be merged into `master`.

## Setting up a development environment

Whether you're interested in contributing to the repository, creating a fork, or just improving your understanding of Streamsync, these are the suggested steps for setting up a development environment.
- You can install the package in editable mode using `poetry install --with build`, which will make it more convenient if you intend to tweak the backend.
- Enable the virtual environment with `poetry shell`
- Run streamsync in port 5000. For example, `streamsync edit hello --port 5000`.
- Install dependencies and run `npm run dev` in `/ui`. This runs the frontend for Streamsync in development mode while proxying requests to port 5000.
- A breakdown of the steps required for packaging can be found in `./build.sh`. Notably, it includes compiling the frontend and taking it from `/ui` and into the Python package.
